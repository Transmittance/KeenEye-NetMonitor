# Ideas to be implemented

### To Do
- [ ] Allow `tcpdump` a specific device
- [ ] Build network graph or traffic map
- [ ] Add manual packets inspetion
- [ ] Add constant background network traffic scan
- [ ] Detect port `SSH` brute, `FTP` brute, `Telnet` brute, `RDP` brute
- [ ] Detect `C2 beaconing`
- ...

### In Progress
- [ ] Convert `pcap` to `flows`, extract features and them feed them to ML
- [ ] Detect port scanning

### Completed 
- ✅ Define a device by its `MAC address` ––––> **as done as possible**
